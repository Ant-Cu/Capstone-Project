# Capstone-Project
This project was done for the purpose of completing my journey at General Assembly in Data Science.  I chose to focus my project on CryptoCurrency trading with BTC and ETH prices. The goal of that study is to identify supports and resistances within a 15min, 60min and daily price timeframe then use the pivot points as indicators for predicting return direction.
